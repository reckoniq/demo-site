New Zealand has three official languages: English, Te Reo Māori, and New Zealand Sign Language.

English is the primary language; however, around 4% (or 140,000) of people speak Te Reo. This makes it the second most commonly spoken language in New Zealand.

The Māori language(opens in new window) is considered a national tāonga (treasure) and is undergoing a significant revival. Initiatives such as Te Wiki o te reo Māori (Māori Language Week), Kura Kaupapa (Māori language schools from pre-school through to high school) and a Māori Television all playing a role in making sure Te Reo Māori remains a living language embraced throughout New Zealand.

You can help support Te Reo Māori by making an effort to get pronunciation right and using simple words and phrases in everyday conversation.

Learning basic Māori greetings (mihi) is a great place to start. Try using these anywhere you go in New Zealand - quite often, the response will be a wide smile.

How do you say hello in Te Reo Māori?
Kia ora - Hello
Mōrena - Good morning
Tēnā koe - Hello to one person
Kia ora/Tēna kōrua - Hello to two people
Kia ora tātou/kia ora koutou - Hello everyone
Tēnā koutou - Greetings to you (said to three or more people)
Nau mai, haere mai - Welcome
Kei te pēhea koe? - How are you?

## Headings in Documentation

Headings are crucial for organizing your documentation and improving readability. Here's how to structure them effectively:

### Project Documentation

Use headings to organize project information, installation guides, and usage instructions.

#### Component Documentation

Document individual components, their props, and usage examples.

##### API Documentation

Detail endpoints, parameters, and response formats.

###### Version Notes

Track changes and updates in your documentation.

## Text Formatting

### Basic Formatting

Regular text can be enhanced with **bold text** for emphasis, _italics_ for secondary emphasis, and `inline code` for technical terms.

### Code Blocks

```javascript
// Example of a JavaScript function
function greetUser(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to our documentation.`;
}
```

### Blockquotes

> Use blockquotes to highlight important notes, warnings, or quotes from team members.
>
> Multiple paragraphs can be included in blockquotes for longer explanations or important sections.

### Lists and Organization

1. **Ordered Lists**
